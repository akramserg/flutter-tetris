# flutter-tetris
A very basic version of tetris built it for fun in a few hours. probably has bugs.

run using 
flutter run -d chrome


I wanted to learn dart with a project and as I enjoy playing tetris a lot I decided to build it using flutter and dart without using any game engines.

It uses drawrect as the main way to draw the field. you will notice so many shortcuts and tricks to make it look and function as tetris (built it in a few hours so I didn't have time to fully leaern what flutter and dart have to offer).

It has been a fun experience and I enjoyed learning a bit about dart. I might never come back to this project but probablty will find new things to do using flutter. This is the only way for me to learn which is by building crappy projects.

Feel free to use this code if you like (Even though I don't reveommend it, it is not that great.)/
